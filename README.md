# ASL-classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
The Deep Learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or ConvNets, are famous for solving Image
classification problems. 
This repository contains a detailed report explaining life cycle of model development and Colab notebooks with example codes on how to build a CNN. <br>
The Colab notebooks contain the information as follow:-

- Build and overfitting model - How to split a data set into train, validation, and test. Build an over-fitting CNN model using a training set.
- Using Data Augmentation - How to use data augmentation in Data Image Generators and to feed images to the CNN models. 
- Using Regularization - How to use regularization techniques like BatchNormalization, L2 regularization and Dropout to control over-fitting.
- Using Advanced Architecture model - How to build a ResNet model, and to use pre-trained models like ResNet50, VGG16, etc.
